## Hi!

I am Luka, a master's student of Computer Engineering at the University of Zagreb and of Space Science and Technology in the [SpaceMaster program](http://spacemaster.eu/).
For further reference, check out my [**CV**](/LSCV.pdf) or my [**LinkedIn account**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lstrz).

## This blog...

... is used to document things that I have been unable to find googling and things that I found fun to share and write about.
