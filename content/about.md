## Hi!

I am Luka, a Software Engineer at Google.
I've graduated Computer Engineering at the University of Zagreb and Space Science and Technology from the [SpaceMaster program](http://spacemaster.eu/).
For further reference, check out my [**resume**](/LSR.pdf) or my [**LinkedIn account**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lstrz/).

## This blog...

... is used to document things that I have been unable to find googling and things that I found fun to share and write about.
