## Hi!

I am Luka, a master's student of Computer Engineering at the University of Zagreb and of Space Science and Technology in the [SpaceMaster program](http://spacemaster.eu/).
For further reference, check out my [**resume**]({{%.Site.Params.cv%}}) or my [**LinkedIn account**]({{.Site.Params.linkedin}}).

## This blog...

... is used to document things that I have been unable to find googling and things that I found fun to share and write about.
